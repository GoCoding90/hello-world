My first repository ! 


  Hello, i am GoCoding90 and this is my first repository ever. Im very excited on learning programming. I also want to learn video games programming , but im also interested in web. So i have so much to learn that i just can't wait to be the programmer i want. The path is long, exhaustive but i know it's a lifechanging carreer.
